## Project Notes

Keycast multi-domain research completed. Key architecture insights:

1. Current state: Single domain (oauth.divine.video), no tenant isolation, SQLite with global unique constraints
2. SQLite limitation: No native Row Level Security like PostgreSQL - must enforce tenant filtering at application level
3. Four patterns identified ranging from simple (separate instances) to complex (shared DB with tenant_id)
4. Recommended Pattern 1 (shared DB + tenant_id) for cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity
5. Critical security requirement: Every query must include tenant_id filter to prevent cross-tenant data leakage
6. Implementation would require: tenant middleware, database migrations, query modifications, frontend routing
7. OAuth multi-tenancy considerations: redirect URIs, NIP-05 discovery, bunker URLs all need tenant scoping

Main blocker: Need to clarify if this is true multi-tenancy (isolated user pools) vs white-label (shared users, different UI). This fundamentally changes architecture requirements.
