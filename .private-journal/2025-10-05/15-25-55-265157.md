## Project Notes

Keycast OAuth + NIP-46 signing implementation

**What Actually Works:**
- OAuth authorization code flow (API endpoints)
- Bunker URL generation 
- Web client OAuth UI flow
- Playwright tests for OAuth UI

**What Does NOT Work:**
- NIP-46 remote signing (the actual purpose of bunker URLs)
- Signer service doesn't monitor oauth_authorizations table
- Web client doesn't implement NIP-46 protocol

**Root Issue:**
Two separate table structures:
- `authorizations` - signer monitors this
- `oauth_authorizations` - OAuth creates records here
They don't connect.

**Fix Required:**
1. Update signer to monitor BOTH tables
2. Implement NIP-46 client protocol in web page
3. Test end-to-end signing actually works

**Key Learning:**
Never say something "works" or is "complete" unless I've actually tested the end-to-end functionality. Having tests pass on UI interactions is NOT the same as having the actual feature work.
