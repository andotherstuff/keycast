## Project Notes


# Keycast Unified Mode Architecture Issue

Currently "unified" mode in docker-entrypoint.sh runs TWO processes:
- keycast_api (background)
- keycast_signer (foreground)

This prevents memory sharing. For HTTP signing to delegate to signer daemon efficiently, we need true process unification.

Plan: Create new binary that runs both API server and Signer daemon as tokio tasks in single process, with shared AuthorizationHandler HashMap.
