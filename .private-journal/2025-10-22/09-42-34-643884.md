## Project Notes


# Keycast HTTP Signing - Decision Point

We have unified binary compiled but not tested. Need to decide:
- Finish unified binary first? (Path A)
- Or get API endpoint working first? (Path B)

Leaning toward: Quick test of unified binary, then decide based on results.

Key insight: Don't over-invest in unproven architecture. Test early, decide based on reality not theory.
