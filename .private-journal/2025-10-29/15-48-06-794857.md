## Project Notes

## Keycast Deployment Architecture

**Active Services** (Cloud Run):
- keycast-unified - Production service at oauth.divine.video
  - Runs API + Signer daemon in one container
  - Port 3000
  - 2Gi memory, 2 CPUs

**Deprecated Services** (don't deploy to these):
- keycast-oauth - Old API-only service
- keycast-oauth-server - Duplicate/abandoned

**Critical Fix**: Updated cloudbuild.yaml to deploy to keycast-unified instead of deprecated keycast-oauth

**Database Migration in Progress**:
- Currently: Ephemeral SQLite with broken litestream backup
- Target: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (db-f1-micro instance)
- IP: 130.211.124.238 (still provisioning)

**Documentation**: Created DEPLOYMENT.md with service architecture, deployment process, and warnings about deprecated services.
