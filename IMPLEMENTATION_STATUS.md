## Detailed Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Database Schema
- [x] User tables (users, user_keys, user_policies)
- [x] Application tables (applications, app_permissions)
- [x] Authorization tables (authorization_requests, authorizations)
- [x] Migration scripts with rollback support
- [x] Backward compatibility with team model

#### Core Types
- [x] `AuthorizationEnhanced` - Dual model support
- [x] `User` - Complete with metadata
- [x] `Application` - Basic structure
- [x] `Policy` - With JSON rules
- [x] `UserKey` - With rotation support
- [x] `AuthorizationRequest` - Full lifecycle
- [x] `Authorization` - Token management
- [ ] `SessionToken` - Planned
- [ ] `RefreshToken` - Planned
- [ ] `PermissionGrant` - Planned

#### Authorization Flow Module (`core/src/authorization_flow/`)
- [x] `AppConnectionAttempt` tracking
- [x] `AuthorizationRequest` management
- [x] `AuthorizationFlowService` orchestration
- [x] Policy evaluation framework
- [x] Template policies for app types

#### API Endpoints - User Management (`/api/users/`)
- [x] **Keys** (`/keys/*`)
  - GET /keys - List user keys
  - POST /keys - Create new key
  - GET /keys/:id - Get specific key
  - PUT /keys/:id - Update key
  - DELETE /keys/:id - Delete key

  - PUT /keys/:id/primary - Set as primary
- [x] **Policies** (`/policies/*`)
  - GET /policies - List policies
  - POST /policies - Create policy
  - GET /policies/:id - Get policy
  - PUT /policies/:id - Update policy

  - GET /authorizations - List authorizations
  - POST /authorizations - Create authorization
  - GET /authorizations/:id - Get authorization
  - PUT /authorizations/:id - Update authorization
  - DELETE /authorizations/:id - Revoke authorization
  - GET /authorizations/:id/bunker-url - Get bunker URL
- [x] **Profile** (`/profile`)
  - GET /profile - Get user profile
  - PUT /profile - Update profile

#### API Endpoints - Authorization (`/api/auth/`)
- [x] **Requests** (`/requests/*`)
  - GET /requests - List pending requests
  - POST /requests/:id/approve - Approve request
  - POST /requests/:id/reject - Reject request

#### Supporting Infrastructure
- [x] Session management with bearer tokens
- [x] Request context with user info
- [x] Error handling framework
- [x] Database connection pooling

### üöß IN PROGRESS

#### Enhanced Signer Daemon
- [x] Basic integration with new auth type
- [ ] Full user-based signing flow
- [ ] Multi-device support
- [ ] Key rotation handling

### ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### API Endpoints - Applications (`/api/applications/`)
- [ ] GET /applications - List registered apps
- [ ] POST /applications - Register new app
- [ ] GET /applications/:id - Get app details
- [ ] PUT /applications/:id - Update app
- [ ] DELETE /applications/:id - Remove app
- [ ] PUT /applications/:id/permissions - Update permissions

#### Frontend Components
- [ ] Login/Registration pages
- [ ] Personal dashboard
- [ ] Key management UI
- [ ] Policy editor
- [ ] Application authorization UI
- [ ] Settings pages

#### Advanced Authentication
- [ ] WebAuthn support
- [ ] OAuth2/OIDC provider
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Biometric support

#### Testing
- [x] Manual test scripts (keys, policies)
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance tests

#### Documentation
- [x] Implementation plans
- [x] Migration guides
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Developer documentation

## Test Scripts Available

1. `/root/repo/test_user_keys.sh` - Tests user key management endpoints
2. `/root/repo/test_user_policies.sh` - Tests policy management endpoints

## Environment Variables

- `USE_ENHANCED_SIGNER` - Enable new signer (default: false)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `RUST_LOG` - Logging configuration

## Known Issues

1. SQLx macro compilation requires DATABASE_URL at compile time
2. Some API endpoints return placeholder "Not implemented" responses
3. Frontend completely team-based, no personal auth UI

## Next Steps

1. **Critical Path**:
   - Implement Application Management API
   - Begin frontend migration
   
2. **Important**:
   - Expand test coverage
   - Update main README.md
   
3. **Nice to Have**:
   - API documentation
   - Performance optimization

## Migration Notes

- Database migrations are backward compatible
- Use `AuthorizationEnhanced` type for dual model support
- Frontend migration will be the most disruptive change
- Plan for gradual rollout using feature flags
