  - GET /applications - List user's connected apps
  - GET /applications/:id - Get user's app details
  - DELETE /applications/:id/revoke - Revoke all app authorizations

#### Supporting Infrastructure
- [x] Session management with bearer tokens

## Test Scripts Available

1. `/root/repo/test_user_keys.sh` - Tests user key management endpoints
2. `/root/repo/test_user_policies.sh` - Tests policy management endpoints
3. `/root/repo/test_applications.sh` - Tests application management endpoints

## Environment Variables

- `USE_ENHANCED_SIGNER` - Enable new signer (default: false)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `RUST_LOG` - Logging configuration

## Known Issues

1. SQLx macro compilation requires DATABASE_URL at compile time
2. Some API endpoints return placeholder "Not implemented" responses
3. Frontend completely team-based, no personal auth UI

## Next Steps

1. **Critical Path**:
   - Implement Application Management API
   - Begin frontend migration
   
2. **Important**:
   - Expand test coverage
   - Update main README.md
   
3. **Nice to Have**:
   - API documentation
   - Performance optimization

## Migration Notes

- Database migrations are backward compatible
- Use `AuthorizationEnhanced` type for dual model support
- Frontend migration will be the most disruptive change
- Plan for gradual rollout using feature flags
