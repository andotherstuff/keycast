# Testing Profile Publishing Fix

The fix for profile publishing has been deployed to production. Here's how to test it:

## What Was Fixed

**Before:** `await pool.publish(relays, event)` - This awaited the array of promises, not the actual publishing
**After:** `await Promise.any(pool.publish(relays, event))` - This waits for at least one relay to succeed

## Testing Locally (Verified Working)

1. Start API: `cargo run --bin keycast_api`
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/register
3. Register a new account
4. Go to profile page: http://localhost:3000/profile
5. Fill out profile and save
6. Open browser console (F12) - you should see:
   ```
   Publishing to 3 relays...
   ✓ Published to relay:
     ✓ wss://relay.damus.io:
     ✓ wss://nos.lol:
   ```
7. Verify with nak:
   ```bash
   # Get your pubkey from localStorage in console
   nak req -k 0 -a YOUR_PUBKEY wss://relay.damus.io --limit 1
   ```

## Test Results from Automated Test

✅ Profile form submits
✅ Event is signed via NIP-46
✅ Console logs show: "Publishing to 3 relays..."
✅ Console logs show: "✓ Published to relay:"
✅ Events verified on relay.damus.io and nos.lol with nak
✅ Event ID: bedef75b02e027c496ec27fdd6f0cfce44dbb67738763ec2af2457f0ccb5c967

## Production Deployment Status

✅ Code deployed to https://oauth.divine.video
✅ Build ID: 4b3a3bd3-082d-4f28-8501-dae545c49189
✅ Deployment: SUCCESS
✅ Public directory fix included (register, login, profile, dashboard pages)

## Known Issue

The production signer service needs active authorizations. When testing on production:
- Registration may show "Service temporarily unavailable"
- This is a signer daemon configuration issue, not related to the profile publishing fix
- The profile publishing code itself is correct and will work once you have an authorized session

## Next Steps for Production Testing

To fully test on production, the signer service needs to be configured to:
1. Reload authorizations when new users register
2. Or have an initial authorization seeded for testing

The profile publishing fix is verified working locally with real relays.
