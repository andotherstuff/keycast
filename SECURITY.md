# Security Policy

## Security Model

Keycast is a hosted NIP-46 (Nostr remote signer) bunker service. We take security seriously and implement multiple layers of protection for your Nostr keys.

### At Rest (Storage)
- ‚úÖ **Keys encrypted** using GCP Cloud KMS with AES-256-GCM
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted blobs** stored in SQLite database
- ‚úÖ **Database encrypted** at rest by Cloud Run infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **KMS access controlled** via IAM with principle of least privilege

### In Transit
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS/TLS 1.3** for all API communication
- ‚úÖ **NIP-44 encryption** for bunker communication over Nostr relays
- ‚úÖ **gRPC with mTLS** for KMS API calls

### In Memory (During Signing)
- ‚úÖ **Immediate zeroization**: Keys zeroed from memory after each signing operation using `zeroize` crate
- ‚úÖ **SecretVec wrapper**: Keys wrapped in secure containers that auto-zero on drop
- ‚úÖ **Minimal exposure**: Keys decrypted only when needed for signing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation**: Keys exist in application memory during signing operations (~milliseconds)

### Audit & Monitoring
- ‚úÖ **All signing operations logged** with user pubkey, event kind, and timestamp
- ‚úÖ **Security validation**: Pubkey mismatch detection (potential compromise indicator)
- ‚úÖ **Cloud Audit Logs**: All KMS decrypt operations logged by GCP
- ‚úÖ **Structured logging**: Easy to parse and alert on anomalies

## Known Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Exposure Risk

**What**: Private keys exist in application memory during signing operations.

**Risk**: If an attacker gains ability to dump process memory, keys could be exposed.

**Mitigations in place**:
- Keys immediately zeroed after use
- SecretVec auto-zeroization on drop
- Container security (read-only filesystem, non-root user)
- Minimal IAM permissions
- Network isolation

**Residual risk**: Sophisticated memory dump attacks (requires server compromise)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Recommended For

- ‚ùå High-value accounts (>$10,000 in associated Lightning/crypto wallets)
- ‚ùå Critical infrastructure keys
- ‚ùå Accounts requiring regulatory compliance (SOC2, PCI-DSS)
- ‚ùå Users in high-threat environments

### ‚úÖ Recommended For

- ‚úÖ General social media posting on Nostr
- ‚úÖ Low-to-medium value accounts
- ‚úÖ Convenience over maximum security use cases
- ‚úÖ Users who understand and accept the trade-offs

## Future Enhancements

We are evaluating Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for a premium tier that would provide additional security guarantees:
- Keys would never exist in application memory
- Signing would occur inside tamper-proof hardware (FIPS 140-2 Level 3)
- Increased cost (~$3-5/month per user vs current $0.10/month)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues.**

Please email: security@keycast.example.com

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours.

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate responsible disclosure and will:
- Acknowledge your contribution
- Provide updates on fixes
- Credit you in our security hall of fame (with your permission)

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions** (within 1 hour):
   - Rotate KMS encryption keys
   - Audit recent signing operations
   - Block suspicious IP addresses

2. **Investigation** (within 24 hours):
   - Identify scope of compromise
   - Determine affected users
   - Assess data exposure

3. **Notification** (within 72 hours):
   - Email affected users
   - Publish incident report
   - Provide remediation steps

4. **Long-term** (within 30 days):
   - Implement additional mitigations
   - External security audit
   - Update security documentation

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Enable 2FA** on your Keycast account
2. **Monitor activity** regularly via audit logs
3. **Use for appropriate use cases** (see recommendations above)
4. **Keep your bunker secret secure** - treat it like a password
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## Compliance & Certifications

**Current status**:
- Infrastructure: GCP (SOC 2, ISO 27001 certified)
- KMS: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified
- Application: Security best practices, not formally audited yet

**Planned**:
- External security audit before public launch
- SOC 2 Type II certification (Year 2)
- Annual penetration testing

## Security Roadmap

**Q1 2025** (MVP):
- ‚úÖ Memory zeroization (zeroize + secrecy)
- ‚úÖ Audit logging
- ‚úÖ Security documentation
- üîÑ External security audit
- üîÑ Automated security scanning (cargo audit in CI)

**Q2 2025** (Growth):
- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- Anomaly detection alerts
- User-facing security dashboard

**Q3 2025** (Scale):
- HSM integration for premium tier
- Bug bounty program
- SOC 2 compliance
